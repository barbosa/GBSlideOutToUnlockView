[![Platform](http://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/p/GBSlideOutToUnlockView/badge.png)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/GBSlideOutToUnlockView)

## Installation

GBSlideOutToUnlockView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "GBSlideOutToUnlockView"
```

But if you don't use CocoaPods, you can just copy the `Classes` folder into your project and add the PNG files inside the `Assets` folder into you projects.

## Screenshots

*Note: The "Unlocked/did not unlock" label is presented only in the Example project. It is not contained inside the component.*

## Usage

To create a **slide to unlock** component programmatically, just instantiate a new `GBSlideOutToUnlockView` with a frame and add it to some view, for example:

```objc
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    GBSlideOutToUnlockView *slideToUnlockView = [[GBSlideOutToUnlockView alloc] initWithFrame:containerView.bounds];
    slideToUnlockView.delegate = self;
    [containerView addSubview:slideToUnlockView];
}
```

And then, implement its protocol to handle its events:

```objc
@protocol GBSlideOutToUnlockViewDelegate <NSObject>
@optional
- (void)slideOutToUnlockViewDidStartToDrag:(GBSlideOutToUnlockView *)slideOutToUnlockView;
- (void)slideOutToUnlockViewDidEndToDrag:(GBSlideOutToUnlockView *)slideOutToUnlockView;
- (void)slideOutToUnlockViewDidUnlock:(GBSlideOutToUnlockView *)slideOutToUnlockView;
- (void)slideOutToUnlockViewDidNotUnlock:(GBSlideOutToUnlockView *)slideOutToUnlockView;
- (void)slideOutToUnlockView:(GBSlideOutToUnlockView *)slideOutView didDragDistance:(CGFloat)distance;
@end
```

You can easily customize your instance of `GBSlideOutToUnlockView` using the properties below

```objc

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat innerCircleRadius;
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat outerCircleRadius;

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *innerCircleColor;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *outerCircleColor;

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *draggableButtonBackgroundColor;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *draggableImageTintColor;

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIImage *draggableImage;
```
